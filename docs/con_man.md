# Twingle API: Configuring the Twingle account on the Twingle website

The use of the Twingle API extension requires that you already have a Twingle account and that you make some settings in this account for the connection.

You will have to make the following settings:

1. API key from your Twingle user

2. Site key

3. URL 

Important: The URL must always be the complete URL to the interface. 
Examples:

- Drupal: https://meine-domain.de/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/rest.php
- Wordpress (with CiviCRM <5.25): https://meine-domain.de/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/rest.php
- Wordpress (with CiviCRM 5.25+): https://meine-domain.de/wp-json/civicrm/v3/rest
