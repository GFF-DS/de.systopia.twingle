# Configuring the Twingle Profile in CiviCRM

The Twingle API extension is being configured through configuration profiles.
This allows you to have different sets of configuration, as you might want to
handle donation submissions differently, depending on which form was used.
Each profile can react to one ore more form IDs being submitted along with
donation data.

1. In CiviCRM, go to **Administer**.
