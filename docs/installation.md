# Installation

You can find an official release archive from
the [release page](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.twingle).

1. First, download and then unpack the archive and move the directory into your
   CiviCRM extensions folder (e.g.,`.../civicrm/ext/`.
   If you don't know where your extensions folder is, just have a look in your
   CiviCRM settings ( **Administer**/**System Settings**/**Directories**)).
2. Next, open the extensions page in the CiviCRM settings (**Administer**/*
   *System Settings**/**Extensions**).
3. Find the extension Twingle API in the*Extensions*tab and click on**Install**.
   The extension will be set up.

## Extended Contact Matcher (XCM)

Please note that for the correct working of Twingle API you still need to
install the extension Extended Contact Matcher (XCM), see
the [documentation](https://docs.civicrm.org/xcm).
